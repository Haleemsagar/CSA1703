% The main predicate to solve the Towers of Hanoi
hanoi(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary) :-
    move(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary).

% Base case: when there is only one disk, simply move it
move(1, Source, Target, _) :-
    write('Move disk 1 from '), write(Source), write(' to '), write(Target), nl.

% Recursive case: move N disks from Source to Target using Auxiliary peg
move(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 1,
    M is N - 1,
    move(M, Source, Auxiliary, Target),     % Move N-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary
    move(1, Source, Target, _),             % Move the N-th disk from Source to Target
    move(M, Auxiliary, Target, Source).     % Move N-1 disks from Auxiliary to Target
